excerpt: 'In this paper we present ULLER: a Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER has a first-order logic syntax specialised for NeSy for which we provide example semantics including classical FOL, fuzzy logic, and probabilistic logic. This paper represents a first step in a longer term project whose goal is to create a library to make NeSy methods more accesible and comparable.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
