permalink: /publication/2025-02-25-beyond-the-convexity-assumption
excerpt: 'This paper is about creating a neural layer able to make any neural network compliant by design with constraints expressed as disjunctions over linear inequalities, i.e., each constraint can have form $$\Phi_1 \vee \Phi_2 \vee \ldots \Phi_n$$, where each $$\Phi_i$$ for $$i = 1, \ldots, n$$ is a linear inequality. This problem is particularly interesting because the constraints can define non-convex and even disconnected spaces.'
