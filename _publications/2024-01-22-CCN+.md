title: "CCN+: A neuro-symbolic framework for deep learning with requirements"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2024-01-22-CCN+
excerpt: 'In this work we present a neural layer able to make any network compliant by design with constraints expressed in full propositional logic. The paper also presents an adaptation of the standard binary cross-entropy loss that guarantees the correct behaviour of the gradients through the layer.'
