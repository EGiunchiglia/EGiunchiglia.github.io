excerpt: 'This paper shows how incorporating logical constraints in the loss function can improve the results in the autonomous driving setting. This application domain is particularly challenging because for every frame we have to encode hundreds of constraints over houndreds of bounding boxes. To overcome the obvious high memory demand, we propose a encoding of the constraints that uses sparse matrices.'
