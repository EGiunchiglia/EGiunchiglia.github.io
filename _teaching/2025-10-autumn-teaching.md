Machine Learning is at the core of contemporary AI research and applications. This module develops a foundation for the mathematical theory underpinning key ML methods which are necessary for their understanding and analysis. The module covers six units: Linear Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, Optimisation, Probability and Statistics. All to establish a comprehensive setting to strenghen the student's understanding of widely used ML models and methods. 

Learning Outcomes
======
On the successful completion of the module, you will be able to: 

- Recognize the role of mathematics in the construction of ML models and their assumptions;
- Understand the key mathematical concepts behind ML methods;
- Identify concepts in ML as particular instances of general mathematical theory;
- Formulate subtasks of a learning problem as mathematical objective 

Content
======

This module will cover the following topics: 

1. **Linear algebra:**
Linear systems, matrices, decompositions, vector spaces and linear independence.
2. **Geometry:**
Inner products, norms, projections, distances and angles.
3. **Calculus:**
Limits, derivatives (scalar, vector and partial), chain rule, backpropagation, Taylor series, integration and the fundamental theorem of Calculus.
4. **Optimisation:**
Convex optimisation, constrained optimisation and Lagrange multipliers, stochastic gradient descent.
5. **Probability:** 
Probability spaces, discrete and continuous random variables, sum/product/Bayes rules, Change-of-Variable theorem, and the Gaussian distribution.
6. **Statistics:**
Learning form data, empirical risk minimisation, bias-variance trade off, the statistical model, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, posterior computation.
